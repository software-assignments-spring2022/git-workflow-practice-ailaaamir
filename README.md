Machine learning is thought to be an optimization of artificial intelligence technologies as the focus is to make computers learn faster from experience. Recently, different technologies such as, big data, data storage solutions, and processing power, have allowed ML to produce more accurate and concise results making it an asset to various different industries. The following are a few examples of how ML is being used in different fields:

- Healthcare: help detect presence of disease
- Retail: Allow online businesses to suggest products
- Banking and Finance: detect and prevent fraudulent transactions
- Transportation: allows self driving cars to interpret, predict, and respond to data for autonomous driving

> The growth of the machine learning industry seems to be an immense jump of 44%, I wonder if the industry would actually be able to achieve $20.83 billion in innovation or if this seems to be a tech bubble due to lack of public understanding - Muhammad Aziz
